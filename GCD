Take the following as input.

A number (N1)
A number (N2)
Write a function which returns the GCD of N1 and N2. Print the value returned.

Input Format
Two integers seperated by a new line.

Constraints
0 < N1 < 1000000000
0 < N2 < 1000000000

Output Format
Output a single integer which is the GCD of the given integers.

Sample Input
16 
24
Sample Output
8
Explanation
The largest number that divides both N1 and N2 is called the GCD of N1 and N2.




#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int a,b;
    cin>>a>>b;
    int i=min(a,b);
    while(i>=1){
        if(a%i==0 and b%i==0){
            cout<<i;
            break;
        }i--;

    }
    return 0;
